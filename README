TMX For Sparrow!

This is my first github project and I am trying to implement tile maps into the sparrow framework.  

Background
-----------
Sparrow Framework - iPhone game engine that makes game development much easier
Tile Maps - I suggest wikipedia for this one, but basically this is using a grid system to define a map
Tiled - A program that creates and exports tilemaps.  It's really neat and I didn't want to write my own tile map editor program.  Tiled is free and is available on most OSs so it was a great choice.

Known issues
----------
The map has a grid on it which is from some sloppy calculation on my part.  I know about this and it's a backburner item for right now.  I am working on creating a simple sample map and code example so it's a little clearer how to use this code.  Stay tuned!
